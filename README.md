`Imagine a world where the terrain can bend to your word. Where merely speaking in chat springs to life mountains, and species of trees never seen before.`

This mod makes it so that whenever someone speaks in chat, the world generation in the mod's target dimension is changed, based on the hash of the message sent.
The mod is configurable via its config file.

Happy exploring ;)
